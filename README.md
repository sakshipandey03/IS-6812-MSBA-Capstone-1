# IS-6812-MSBA-Capstone- Home Credit Default Risk
## Business Problem & Project Objective
Home Credit Group has a core mission of providing financial solutions to individuals with limited or no credit history. A significant challenge they encounter is accurately evaluating credit risk to prevent loan defaults while ensuring deserving clients can access loans. Despite their mission, traditional credit scoring methods often fall short when assessing the creditworthiness of individuals without substantial credit histories. This challenge leads to a dilemma where Home Credit must strike a balance between minimizing loan defaults and granting loans to deserving clients. To address this, Home Credit utilizes various data sources, including telecom and historical transactional data, to enhance the overall borrowing experience. However, the central business problem remains: how to accurately evaluate credit risk and ensure loans are extended responsibly.

In response to the business problem, Home Credit's project focuses on several key objectives: 
1) Identification of Creditworthy Individuals without Credit History: Develop supervised predictive classification models, such as Logistic Regression, leveraging historical labeled data to identify potential customers with higher probabilities of loan repayment.
2) Reduction of Loan Rejections for Eligible Applicants: Utilize ensemble methods alongside logistic regression to refine the loan approval process, ensuring deserving applicants are not unjustly denied credit.
3) Ensuring Responsible Loan Extensions: Evaluate a client's likelihood to meet their loan obligations, effectively utilizing the target variable to distinguish between customers likely to repay on time and those who may face difficulties.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand the dataset and its characteristics. The following steps were taken as part of this analysis:
1) Data Import and Initial Inspection: Importing the dataset and performing an initial inspection to understand its structure, variables, and the target variable.
2) Target-Predictor Relationship Exploration: Exploring the relationship between the target variable and predictor variables.
3) Handling Missing Values: Assessing the scope of missing values and implementing strategies for imputation.
4) Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Analyzing individual variables to understand their distributions and characteristics. Additionally, investigating relationships between pairs of variables to identify correlations and dependencies.
5) Data Integration and Inspection: Joining additional datasets, such as Bureau data or previous application tables, if available, and inspecting the combined dataset for insights.

## Business Problem Solution
The exploration data analysis (EDA) notebooks are crucial for understanding Home Credit's default risk landscape. We conduct data cleaning and transactional data analysis by analyzing datasets like the Application (Train/Test) and Bureau datasets. This process aims to answer crucial questions, such as the impact of gender, income, or credit sum on default rates and whether factors like region, occupation, and family structure play a role. Following the EDA, we develop predictive models to evaluate credit default risk. We start with logistic regression and explore penalized regression methods. Additionally, we examine ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost to assess their effectiveness in predicting default risk. We aim to identify the best-performing model based on metrics like accuracy and ROC values, with Kaggle scores guiding our selection process. By employing advanced machine learning algorithms, this model can identify critical factors linked to default, such as income, employment status, and debt-to-income ratio. This thorough assessment enables Home Credit to make better decisions about loan extensions, thereby reducing default risk and increasing profitability. Moreover, utilizing default/non-default information allows Home Credit to refine its lending practices over time, leading to higher profit rates. It benefits the company and customers by providing insights into their credit assessments and empowering them to make more informed financial decisions. In summary, by integrating advanced predictive models like XGB with thorough exploration data analysis and model development, Home Credit can effectively reduce default rates while enhancing customer experiences and profitability.

## Individual Contribution
In our project on improving loan default prediction at Home Credit, I addressed the challenge of class imbalance within the target variable. After preprocessing the data, I constructed the logistic regression model, a fundamental statistical method for binary classification problems like predicting credit default risk. I implemented the logistic regression model to handle the class imbalance issue, starting with data preprocessing using sklearn techniques. After training the model, I achieved an accuracy of 69%, RMSE of 0.56, and ROC-AUC score of 0.685 on the validation dataset. Using the model, I made predictions on the test data, obtaining a Kaggle score of 0.67522. My work represents a significant step in reducing risks associated with loan defaults, directly impacting Home Credit's bottom line.
