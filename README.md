# IS-6812-MSBA-Capstone- Home Credit Default Risk
## Business Problem & Project Objective.
Home Credit Group has a core mission of providing financial solutions to individuals with limited or no credit history. A significant challenge they encounter is accurately evaluating credit risk to prevent loan defaults while ensuring deserving clients can access loans. Despite their mission, traditional credit scoring methods often fall short when assessing the creditworthiness of individuals without substantial credit histories. This challenge leads to a dilemma where Home Credit must strike a balance between minimizing loan defaults and granting loans to deserving clients. To address this, Home Credit utilizes various data sources, including telecom and historical transactional data, to enhance the overall borrowing experience. However, the central business problem remains: how to accurately evaluate credit risk and ensure loans are extended responsibly.

In response to the business problem, Home Credit's project focuses on several key objectives. Firstly, the company aims to identify creditworthy individuals without a credit history. This involves the development of supervised predictive classification models, such as Logistic Regression, leveraging historical labeled data. These models will extract a list of potential customers with higher probabilities of loan repayment, based on alternative data sources like telco and transactional information. Secondly, Home Credit seeks to reduce the number of loan rejections for eligible applicants. By utilizing ensemble methods alongside logistic regression, the project aims to refine the loan approval process, ensuring that deserving applicants are not unjustly denied credit. Finally, the project aims to ensure loans are not extended to individuals who are unable to meet their payment commitments. This objective involves evaluating a client's likelihood to meet their loan obligations, effectively utilizing the target variable to distinguish between customers likely to repay on time and those who may face difficulties. Overall, the project aims to enhance Home Credit's ability to assess credit risk accurately, reduce loan rejections for eligible applicants, and ensure loans are granted responsibly to those who can reasonably meet their payment commitments.
